The Knowledge House foundations assignment 
I have to say, this was one of the toughest things I've ever had to code and partake in. It was a humbling experience. I was tasked with creating a portfolio for my future coding projects. The goal was to create a homepage with a navigation bar and each bar leading to another. I was a bit crunched for time; I really wish I had more time to work on the About Me section, but we have some time to improve and do so. The contact page was the hardest to code; I did rely on W3 schools, Stack Overflow, and ChatGPT for clarification on methods. I'm really thankful for the experience of coding something from Figma to a published site. Doing this assignment solidified my goals. I 1000% want to become a software developer. This was a blast, and I can't wait to learn and incorporate JavaScript.
