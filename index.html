            <h1>Welcome my friends, I guess this is the official start to my Coding Journey...</h1>
            <p>I know what you're thinking, "That's alot of white space." Well I gotta leave some room for improvement. I’m a driven and adaptable individual with a wide range of personal interests and activities that fuel my passion for growth and innovation. I’ve always been curious about learning. I read as much as I can because I want to check off as many unknowns as I can before my death. Currently, I’m working toward finishing my Bachelor’s in Computer Science with a minor in Math, as I aim to secure my first tech role. My love for coding is undeniable—I dedicate evenings after class to honing my skills and creating projects. It’s not just a career path for me; it’s a rooted passion that pushes me to grow constantly. I would like to leave you with a quote I made. Failure is one of my proudest accomplishments."When someone fails, it is followed by tumultuous growth and the potential to succeed intensifies. When I lose: I smile, I laugh, I embrace the negativity. For I only see an opportunity in the making."</p>
            <p1>Yours Truly,</p1>
